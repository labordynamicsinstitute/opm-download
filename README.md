Download and read-in scripts to pull down OPM Fedscope data

## Data source
Data is pulled from URL at [doc/SRC.txt]. Additional documents are also available in the [doc/] folder.

## Programs
The [programs/] folder contains programs that download the data (no longer works as of 2015-11-11 without human intervention, so download happens through a Firefox window), and then to read it in (SAS).
